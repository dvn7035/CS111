Implementation notes for Lab 1A:

This program appears to be fully functional for all test cases tested in the
shell scripts provided. Beyond that, there are no known possible cases where the
command parser will output an incorrect command tree. When an error occurs, the
program will print the line where the error occured with a short description of 
what error the program encountered.

Current Limitations:

- None encountered
