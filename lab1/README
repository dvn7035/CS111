Implementation notes for Lab 1A:

This program appears to be fully functional for all test cases tested in the
shell scripts provided. Beyond that, there are no known possible cases where the
command parser will output an incorrect command tree. When an error occurs, the
program will print the line where the error occured with a short description of 
what error the program encountered.

Current Limitations:

- None encountered
- A script ending in a comment returns errors

Implementation notes for Lab 1B:
Lab 1B is tested for most basic test cases but has not been comprehensively
tested for all cases. The main function of execute-command.c is execute(command)
which recursively calls itself until it reaches a simple command. forks are used
in order to retrieve status codes from a successful or unsuccessful command
execution.


Current Limitations:

-Any script that is incorrectly parsed by read-command in 1A will not work for 1B
